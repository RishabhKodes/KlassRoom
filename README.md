<h2><B>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</B></h2><p>

It can be really hard to process class lectures and take notes effectively. Also, lectures listened to at home<BR>
are very difficult to pay attention to and garner information from. Finally, lectures can be disinteresting<BR>
and can often require supplemental resources.Therefore, we created StudeNT_Search is built to increase<BR>

<h2><b> REAL WORLD PROBLEM AIMED TO SOLVE</h2>
<p>It can be really hard to process class lectures and take notes effectively. Also, lectures listened to at home<br>
are very difficult to pay attention to and garner information from. Finally, lectures can be disinteresting<br>
and can often require supplemental resources. Under privileged students in their house are not getting<br>
proper environment to study or focus on the lectures taught by the teachers and then high amount of data<br>
is wasted in the surfing on the internet of the topic that was taught by the teacher in the recent class which<br>
may effect the pocket oh their parents in this pandemic situation.</p>

<h3><b>SOLUTION</b><h3>
<p>
To make a project that transforms your online class to Google Search ,YouTube videos,<br>
and Transcript of the whole class in form of google docs so that if you don’t able to listen<br>
to your teacher then due to voice lagging or low internet connnectivities , you can check<br>
the transcript afterwards.
Google Search means that it’ll find some topics that may<br> be explained by the teacher and
searches on the google to save time and find relevant material.<br>
YouTube Search means that it’ll search on the youtube to find the relevant and specific<br>
videos on the topics taught by the teacher in most recent class .
